# Approach Explanation â€“ Adobe Techverse 2025: Challenge 1B

## Persona-Driven Document Intelligence System

Our solution extracts and prioritizes the most relevant sections from PDF collections based on a specific **persona** and their **job-to-be-done**. The system intelligently filters vast document collections to surface only the content that matters most to the user's role and objectives.

## ðŸ§  Core Methodology

### **1. Document Processing Pipeline**
The system reads `challenge1b_input.json` to understand the persona context, job requirements, and target PDF list. For each document collection, it employs a hybrid approach:

- **Primary Strategy**: Leverages Challenge 1A outline JSONs when available for precise section boundaries
- **Fallback Strategy**: Uses heuristic-based segmentation analyzing text patterns, font variations, and structural cues
- **Last Resort**: Page-by-page content analysis with intelligent text splitting

### **2. Intelligent Section Extraction**
Documents are segmented using multiple techniques:
- **Outline-Based**: Uses 1A results to create accurate section boundaries with proper page mapping
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects common document structures (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, etc.)
- **Heuristic Analysis**: Identifies headings through formatting cues and positioning

### **3. Relevance Scoring System**
Each section receives a relevance score through a weighted combination of:

- **TF-IDF Similarity**: Semantic matching between section content and persona/job keywords
- **Keyword Coverage**: Direct matching of domain-specific terms expanded through lexical analysis
- **Content Quality**: Length and density metrics to ensure substantial, meaningful sections

**Scoring Formula**: `0.6 Ã— TF-IDF + 0.3 Ã— Keyword Coverage + 0.1 Ã— Content Quality`

### **4. Domain-Aware Intelligence**
The system includes specialized knowledge for different domains:
- **Academic Research**: Methodology, results, benchmarks terminology
- **Business Analysis**: Financial, investment, market positioning terms  
- **Educational Content**: Learning objectives, key concepts, exam preparation focus
- **Travel Planning**: Accommodation, transport, activities, budget terms

## ðŸ“Š Ranking & Prioritization Strategy

Sections are ranked across the entire document collection using a unified scoring system. This ensures the most relevant content rises to the top regardless of source document, providing focused results that match the persona's specific needs.

The top N sections (configurable, default 10) are selected and assigned importance ranks, with each section's most representative sentences extracted for quick scanning.

## ðŸ”§ Subsection Analysis

For each high-ranked section, the system performs sentence-level extraction:
- **Quality Scoring**: Sentences ranked by position, length, and discourse markers
- **Diversity Filtering**: Ensures varied, non-redundant content selection  
- **Concise Summaries**: Provides 2-3 key sentences per section for rapid comprehension

## âœ… Technical Compliance

- **CPU-Only Operation**: Uses lightweight TF-IDF vectorization and sklearn
- **Offline Processing**: No network calls or external API dependencies
- **Performance Optimized**: Processes 3-5 documents in under 60 seconds
- **Memory Efficient**: Model size well under 1GB limit
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for edge cases and malformed PDFs

## ðŸŽ¯ Generalization Across Domains

The solution adapts to diverse document types and use cases:
- **Research Papers**: Literature reviews, methodology extraction
- **Financial Reports**: Revenue analysis, investment trends  
- **Educational Materials**: Exam preparation, concept identification
- **Technical Documentation**: Process guides, troubleshooting steps

## ðŸ“‹ Output Structure

Results are delivered in the specified JSON format containing:
- **Metadata**: Input files, persona, job description, processing metrics
- **Extracted Sections**: Top-ranked sections with titles, pages, and importance scores
- **Subsection Analysis**: Refined sentence-level insights for quick consumption

## ðŸš€ Key Advantages

**Smart Prioritization**: Surfaces the most relevant content instead of overwhelming users with everything

**Domain Intelligence**: Built-in understanding of different document types and professional contexts  

**Hybrid Processing**: Combines structured outline data with intelligent fallback segmentation

**Quality Assurance**: Multi-layered filtering ensures high-signal, low-noise results
